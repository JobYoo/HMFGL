# Hybrid Multimodal Fusion for Graph Learning in Disease Prediction(HMFGL)

This is a PyTorch version of HMFGLmodel as proposed in our paper.

## Introduction
<<<<<<< HEAD
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in disease prediction where the node represents users' latent features and the edge denotes the similarity relationship between two users. The graph plays a crucial role in graph learning by determining information aggregation and propagation. However, recent methods typically construct graphs based on user's latent embeddings, which may not accurately reflect real-world connections. We observe meta data (e.g., demographic attributes, genetic markers) provide abundant information to gauge user similarities, and could compensate the weakness of graph construction from latent representation. Therefore, we propose to combine graphs learned from patient meta data and multimodal representation through a weighted summation.  Considering the graphs could include irrelevant and noisy connections, we employ the degree-sensitive edge pruning and KNN sparsification to sparsify and prune such edges.
